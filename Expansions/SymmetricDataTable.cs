    /// <remarks>
    /// Implementing this class is really easy. While getting the key before pairing function, we sort the hash values, so it doesn't matter which hash is which object's.
    /// For example, say we have object A and object B. Let hash code of A be 1 and B be 2.
    ///     - CalculateKey (A, B) --> Pair (Max (A,B), NotMax (A,B)) = Pair (2,1).
    ///     - CalculateKey (B, A) --> Pair (Max (B,A), NotMax (B,A)) = Pair (2,1).
    /// As you see, the pair remains same no matter the order of objects.
