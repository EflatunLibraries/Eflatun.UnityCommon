# Eflatun.UnityCommon #

This library includes common code that are shared across my Unity projects.


Dependencies
---
- [Eflatun.Expansions](https://github.com/starikcetin/Eflatun.Expansions)


Folders
---
- Inspector:      Editor and Inspector.
- Utils:          Utilities, helpers, extensions, etc.


Notes
---
- You may prefer using this library as a subtree (or submodule) in your git repository.
- *Editor* folders are special folders that Unity use to identify editor-only scripts. So all *Editor* folders in this framework are intended for that purpose. Thus, do not use *Editor* as a custom folder name, use *Inspector* instead.
